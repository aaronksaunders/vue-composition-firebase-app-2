## Overview

We are going to use the new VueJS Composition API to seperate out Firebase integration into a VueJS Application. We will focus in this blog post on determining if there is already user information associated with the application saved or if the user needs to login to the application. If the user needs to login to the application we will provide the ability to login and logout of firebase using the composition api application structure
